The September 2024 meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 9th of September, from 6:00pm
to 8:00pm (meeting starts at 6:30pm).

This time we're being hosted by the lovely folk at
[Bloom & Wild](https://www.bloomandwild.com/careers) in [their offices][bloom-and-wild-venue], near Vauxhall. [Full venue and registration details are given
below](#september24registration).

## Agenda

### B&W Rewards - Domains, Events & Ledgers

[Rachel Bingham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-bingham/) and Boaz Yehezkel will be speaking about:

> How we developed the B&W Rewards system. 
> Starting from event storming with stakeholders and technical planning across squads to clear domain boundaries to  
> how we used an event bus and agnostic accounting system to keep things clear, concise and extendable.


## Afterwards

After the talks are finished, and we've tidied up the venue a bit, we head over
to a local pub for some food and drinks and the opportunity to chat with each
other.

Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our [code of conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct).

## Venue & Registration {#september24registration}

Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our

conduct](http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct) which applies to all

We are trialling a new ticketing platform, Ticket Tailor. Do let us know how you
find the user flow on it.
